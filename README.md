# Documentation_Automation
Documentation Automation automates the process of sanitizing internal documents for external use. It scans specified directories, removes confidential sections marked with tags, and replicates the cleaned documents while maintaining the original structure. Supports Markdown, plain text, and restructured Text file formats.
